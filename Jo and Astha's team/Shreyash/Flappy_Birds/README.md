# Drogo Bird

This is a slightly modified Flappy Birds game. The protagonist is changed from the much known flappy bird to Drogo the Dragon.
He was the odd of the bunch and couldn't breathe fire like the rest of his friends but he had another special ability. He could be invincible when he got happy. His other friends picked up on him by saying that this is a cowards superpower, "A real dragon burn the enemies." they said. But Drogo always knew his powers will help him someday. So here we are, The game. You control Drogo as he flies through this forest, you will fall if you hit the tress so stay away from them. When Drogo passes enough tree he gets happy and he becomes invincible for 15 seconds.
